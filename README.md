# Hedging and Cross Gamma: A Comparative Study Using Machine Learning and Traditional Methods

>The derivatives market is inherently complex, with risk factors such as cross-gamma exposure posing significant challenges to traders. Cross-gamma, the second-order cross-partial derivatives of the derivative price concerning changes in the values of multiple underlying assets, introduces an intricate layer of risk that demands sophisticated hedging strategies. In this study, we aim to delve into the industry problem of determining the effectiveness of hedging mechanisms in mitigating cross-gamma risks
